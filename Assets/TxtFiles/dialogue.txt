Hi there. Why don't you send me on a quest so you can keep studying!
Let me handle the questing. I'll leave the study to you.
There is always more one can learn. The journey of knowledge has no end.
I'm itching for an adventure!
You've a questing adventurer of great renown sitting here idle you know. Use me.
Our enemies rejoice that I am here and not on the trail of justice!
Did I ever tell you of the time I smote a mighty bone dragon with naught but my fists? No? Well perhaps another time you should really be studying.
Woe is me! To be shackled here and not hunting fell creatures or saving beautiful damsels in need. You must loose me on the world. 
I believe in you! No task is too great if you give yourself to it entirely.
A mighty warrior and a most devout scholar. We make quite the team you and i. 
I'm sure theres someone somewhere in need of my assistance. Likewise im sure there's a page or question that would benefit from your attention.
