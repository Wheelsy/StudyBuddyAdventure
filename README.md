# Study Buddy Adventure

Study Buddy Adventure is an application based on the Pomodoro technique. The aim is to help you focus on studying for a selected period of time followed by a short break. Let your buddy do the adventuring while you hit the books!

To play, go to the quest menu and select a quest of a particular length and difficulty to send your buddy on. The longer and more difficult the quest, the greater the potential rewards. While your buddy's out adventuring, it's time for you to study! A timer will appear on your screen, and when it hits 0, your buddy will return having succeeded or failed in their quest. This is when you should take a break and check how your buddy did. They also have a chance to bring back gold and items to aid you in future quests.

Inside the shop menu, you will be able to purchase backgrounds and music to use in the app.
